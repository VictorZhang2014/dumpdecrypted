## dumpdecrypted
Dumps decrypted iPhone Applications to a file - better solution than those GDB scripts for non working GDB versions

## How to compile it?
1.First, adjust the Makefile if you have a different iOS SDK installed.

2.And then, just use of the command : `make`, that operation will generate a dylib library.

## Usage
It dumps the shell of applications, wherever it comes from iPod/iPhone/iPad, even if those of that will download from the App Store.
iPod:~ root# 
```
DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=dumpdecrypted.dylib /var/mobile/Applications/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/Scan.app/Scan
```
mach-o decryption dumper

## dumpdecrypted
dumpdecrypted是一个脱壳工具，可以对从App Store上下载的应用进行脱壳，以便于安全分析人员可以进行分析。
这里要感谢Stefan Esser提供的这个开源的库，在我们做iOS逆向分析的时候，提供了很大的帮助！

## 如何编译它了？
1.下载这个库到你的电脑上（这里我使用的是MacBook Pro），并且`cd`到该库的目录；

2.在终端(Terminal)下使用命令 `make`，就可以生成一个`dumpdecrypted.dylib`文件，这个文件就是当我们对其他可执行文件进行脱壳时要使用的。

## 使用方式
这个库可以对从App Store下载的应用进行脱壳，可以是iPod,iPhone,iPad
例如：以下命令就是对Scan.app进行脱壳
```
DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=dumpdecrypted.dylib /var/mobile/Applications/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/Scan.app/Scan
```
